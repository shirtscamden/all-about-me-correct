    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Camden Shirts, and I am a <em>born and raised</em> Utahn!</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Some of the things that I <em>LOVE</em> are pickleball, hiking, camping, golf, ice hockey,
        sports, spending time with my wife, and doing anything outdoors!</p>

    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>I am an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I love everything about the gospel and the hope that it brings into my life. I'm so grateful to have been so close to Christ in recent years. I was able to serve a mission in California Anaheim speaking sign language, and it was <em>THE BEST EVER!</em></p>

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>I come from a family of five. I fall under the middle child category, with my older sister being two years older than me and my younger brother being three years younger. I love my family so much; they are so much fun. My parents love to vacation and hang out with us kids.</p>
